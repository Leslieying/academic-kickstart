	abstract = {Background and Objectives: The rapid spread of invasive Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in the mangrove ecosystems of China was reduced using Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. as an ecological replacement. Here, we studied the effects of invasion and ecological replacement using S. apetala on soil organic carbon fractions and stock on Qi\&rsquo;ao Island. Materials and Methods: Seven sites, including unvegetated mudflat and S. alterniflora, rehabilitated mangroves with different ages (one, six, and 10 years) and mature native Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu, and Yong areas were selected in this study. Samples in the top 50 cm of soil were collected and then different fractions of organic carbon, including the total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), soil water dissolved carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and the total carbon stock were measured and calculated. Results: The growth of S. alterniflora and mangroves significantly increased the soil TOC, POC, and MBC levels when compared to the mudflat. S. alterniflora had the highest soil DOC contents at 0\&ndash;10 cm and 20\&ndash;30 cm and the one-year restored mangroves had the highest MBC content. S. alterniflora and mangroves both had higher soil total carbon pools than the mudflat. Conclusions: The invasive S. alterniflora and young S. apetala forests had significantly lower soil TOC and POC contents and total organic carbon than the mature K. obovata on Qi\&rsquo;ao Island. These results indicate that ecological replacement methods can enhance long term carbon storage in Spartina-invaded ecosystems and native mangrove species are recommended.},

	abstract = {In this study, we explored the individual and combined effects of ammonia-N and sulfide stress (1 mg/L sulfide and 15 mg/L ammonia-N) on the oxidation resistance, immune response and intestinal health of Litopenaeus vannamei during 72 h exposure. The total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), malonaldehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity (CAT), the immune-relative gene (caspase-3, hsp70 and IMD) expression in hepatopancreas and intestine of L.vannamei and the intestinal microbiota were measured. The result showed that MDA and NO contents in hepatopancreas of L. vannamei in all treatment groups increased and remain were at high levels at the end of the stress exposure. The L. vannamei employ antioxidant defense system by increasing the activities of T-AOC, SOD and CAT enzymes in hepatopancereas and intestine to reduce oxidant damage. More severe damages with combined ammonia-N and sulfide stress to antioxidant systems were observed. The gene expression results also demonstrated that antioxidant capacity of L. vannamei was severely impaired and the apoptosis cell was initiated under the ammonia-N and sulfide stress. In addition, the environmental stress also reshaped the intestinal microbial community structure of L. vannamei that a number of original genera decreased, such as Cellvibrio, Vibrio and Rheinheimera; some new genera increased or appeared, such as Photobacterium in all treatment groups, Arcobacter and Fusibacter in sulfide stress group. Therefore, the health of L. vannamei was severely impacted when exposed to the stress of ammonia nitrogen and sulfide and these two factors can have weak synergic effects.},

	abstract = {The general relationship indicating that biomass decreases with individual body size is referred to as size spectra. This is consistent with the power law that characterizes size frequency distributions. While many previous studies have used the estimated exponent in size spectra as a metric to assess external perturbations, limited empirical studies have focused on the fitting methods. Here, we compared the effects caused by fitting methods and distribution models based on one-year pelagic fish data from Daya Bay, China. Our empirical results showed that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is more suitable than traditional normalized biomass spectra (NBS), and that a power law is not always the best model when using MLE. Moreover, we found significant size structure variation in different seasons. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear mixed effects model (LMM) results showed that temperature was the major factor in seasonal environmental variation, and fish migration might be the essential response strategy causing size structure changes. The estimated exponents and nonlinear structure indicated that the Daya Bay is under intensive human impact. Our results suggest that MLE methods are recommended in future size-based studies, and that environmental variation and migration patterns are crucial in understanding seasonal community structure changes.},

	abstract = {Offshore marine areas have diverse habitats and food sources which lead to dynamic exchanges of nutrients and energy between different water layers. Coupling of energy pathways is related to both physical (e.g., sedimentation) and biological (e.g., predation) processes. However, due to the biological processes affected by human influences, the variability and dynamics of this coupling are not well quantified. Daya Bay, a subtropical semi-closed gulf affected by human activities, was studied to assess dynamics of pelagic-benthic coupling affected by trophical interaction. Stable isotope analyses of three main functional groups (pelagic fish, demersal fish, and benthic crustaceans) were conducted to assess trophic interactions, and trait-based functional indices were calculated to reveal the changes of community structure. The environmental variations, including chlorophyll a concentration, phytoplankton, and zooplankton abundance were monitored to explain the potential causes. The results showed that pelagic-benthic coupling effects were strong and seasonally dynamic in Daya Bay. Most nekton organisms were largely ({\textgreater}55\%) fueled by pelagic production and exhibited high trophic overlap. In spring, when resources were limited, the proportion of the pelagic contribution to all the groups was highest, while greater trophic partitioning was observed. The trait-based functional diversity indices showed that the functional richness is extremely low in all seasons. However, the functional evenness and dispersion indices increased from winter to spring to summer. Our observation suggests that plankton abundance caused this seasonal pattern by controlling the strength of competitive interactions. Our study highlights the dynamic of pelagic-benthic coupling strength caused by trophic interaction across different environmental conditions of coastal ecosystems, this might provide important sighting on the coastal food web study and fishery management.},
